# The Reason for The Number of Deaths from Covid-19 in The World in 2021.07.21


This project was created to observe and analyze Covid 19 cases in 2021. During my analyses, I saw an anomaly in the data and investigated the cause of this anomaly. You can download the pdf in the repository to access my analysis. At the same time, I shared the images I created during my analysis, the dataset I used and my source code. Finally, I created a chart for my country, Turkey, and added it to the repository.

The dataset I use belongs to the World Health Organization and you can reach the download page from this link:
