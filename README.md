# 2021-worldwide-covid19-deaths

This project was created to observe and analyze Covid 19 cases in 2021. During my analyses, I saw an anomaly in the data and investigated the cause of this anomaly. You can download the pdf in the repository to access my analysis. At the same time, I shared the images I created during my analysis, the dataset I used and my source code. Finally, I created a chart for my country, Turkey, and added it to the repository.
